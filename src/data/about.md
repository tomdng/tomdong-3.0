After finishing high school I was at odds figuring out what I should be doing for the rest of my life. My high school electives looked a little bit like a "how to get into STEM" guide while at home I was making 3D art whenever I had the free time.

While the specifics of what I wanted to do weren't there, I knew I had to be in a place where I could build things. Not only did I want to build things but I also wanted to make meaningful tools and experiences.

As I studied computer science, I discovered the world of web development. From designing the look and feel of a website, then bringing those UI concepts to life with something like ReactJS, and finally optimizing the performance and accessbility of the final product is something that requires a team of people who can solve problems but with a creative twist to it. Now I know what I want to do.

While I do have an eye for design and I also work on backend development, the sum of my experiences currently make me a front-end developer. Regardless, I'm here to learn everything possible and I first and foremost am a creatively-orientated problem solver more than anything.
