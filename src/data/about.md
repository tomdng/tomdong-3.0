When I was growing up there were two big parts of my life that always seemed distinct from each other. One side was a lot creative, as I became interested in photography, filmmaking, and 3D animation. But on the other side I enjoyed engineering and being able to do things like creating robots and developing websites.

But the common thread I realized about the two is that I simply just like building things. Taking ideas and turning them into reality is what I try to do in my day to day life.

At college I’m in an organization where every day I watch people build carbon fiber drones from the ground up, while I design and develop webapps for that same team on the software side.

As for where the future is for me, design-orientated front-end development is ultimately what I want to do. To be able to contribute to both the creative and technical side of a project while also being the bridge between two different teams is the dream that I’m working on.
