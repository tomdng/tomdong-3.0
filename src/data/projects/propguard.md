Propguard aims to teach intermediate level code for people who already know the basics of programming, but haven't gotten the chance to use them in a pactical way. It's especially helpful for programming libraries that don't have a lot of tutorials.

Currently it's used to teach people how to use flight code libraries for my autonomous drone design team, but with a few minor changes you can easily adapt this tool for literally any niche beginner topic you like.

Build in TypeScript React with GatsbyJS so you don't even need a backend to host this tool.
