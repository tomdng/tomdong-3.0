## Check out the design

You know how we have open-source code? Well designers have been taking notice of us developers so they've also started an open-source movement with open-source design.

I'll share my Figma project that you can learn off of just as I'm learning off of everyone else's Figma projects.

_Figma link will be added sortly._

1. Clone the repository and move to its folder

```sh
git clone https://github.com/tomdng/tomdong-3.0.git && cd tomdong-3.0
```

2. Install the required packages for the project

```sh
yarn install
```

3. Run the development version of Propguard
