## Check out the design

You know how we have open-source code? Well designers have been taking notice of us developers so they've also started an open-source movement with open-source design.

I'll share my Figma project that you can learn off of just as I'm learning off of everyone else's Figma projects.

_Figma link will be added sortly._

## Play around with my code

1. Clone the repository and move to its folder

```sh
git clone https://github.com/tomdng/tomdong-3.0.git && cd tomdong-3.0
```

2. Install the required packages for the project

```sh
yarn install
```

3. Run the development version of Propguard

```sh
yarn start
```

4. Now play around, code, and enjoy!

## Using my code/design

I'm not sure if either my code or design is worth stealing from. If you think it is, please don't use it for commercial purposes. That's just mean.

As far as personal use, go ahead! But the artist in me really wants to ask you if you really are fine just straight up copy-pasting design and code with customizing or remixing it. You'll learn a lot more if you put your twist on it. Plus, you'll be original. Win and win!
